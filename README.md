## Idea brief

BookMydose is a web-based Application platform to connect users directly with nearby hospitals and facilitate the process of scheduling an appointment with the hospital to get vaccinated. Using our platform, the user has to fill a registration form providing necessary details which will be shared to the hospital. Then, the user can choose from available date and time slots, & Register self with his details. Later, the user can visit the chosen hospital according to the scheduled appointment.
 
## Why our platform?
 
- Proper Management of Vaccine Distribution.
- Database of all Registered people.
- Reducing possible crowding at clinics/ hospitals when the vaccine becomes public.
- On the admin side, a proper database of users and hospitals will be maintained to track the progress and maintain the records of vaccine distribution easily and efficiently.
